# Copy the book's markdown from the source repository into this site.
#
# The site vendors the prose rather than building from a checkout of the book,
# so that `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` work standalone. The cost is that the copy
# goes stale: run this after the book changes, then commit the result.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/sync-content.sh [path-to-public-value-guide]
#
# The default path assumes the two repositories are siblings:
#   public-value-guide/
#   ├── public-value-guide/            <- the book
#   └── public-value-guide.github.io/  <- this site

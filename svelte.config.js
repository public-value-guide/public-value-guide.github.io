     * workflow. That is for a *project* site, served from a subpath at

     * which makes it the organisation's root site: it is served from the domain
     * root, so the base path is empty and copying that step would prefix every
     * URL with `/public-value-guide.github.io` and break the whole site.
     *
     * Wiring `base` up "just in case" would also be inert unless every link and
     * the ThemePicker's `themesUrl` were routed through it, so the site uses
     * plain root-relative paths and this comment instead.
